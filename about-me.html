        <img src="img/fred.img.jpg" alt="Fredrick">
        <p>I am an electrical engineer by profession with over 8 yearsâ€™ experience in radio access network maintenance. I studied electrical and telecommunications engineering at Moi university graduating with a second-class honor in the year 2011. I joined Safaricom limited in 2012 and worked as a network operations engineer for two years before moving to the regional operations department where I have worked as a RAN maintenance engineer for the last eight years. </p>
        <p>After 10 years of doing more or less the same thing I decided to re skill myself and get to know other new skills that I hope not only to help my career growth but to also help find new ways of executing my duties and thus increase the overall quality of my output at my current workstation.  </p>
